# Matrix Vision
Hello from inside the Matrix.

This project livestreams from your webcam to put you inside the Matrix, mapping each raining katakana character to a corresponding pixel brightness / color value.

To get this up, clone this repo, run `http-server` and open up your browser on local host. Avoid being backlit for best results.

This builds on top of a previous project I'd done, which was a reproduction of a 2D digital rain animation: https://github.com/emilyxxie/green_rain
